      Let's start by plotting the monthly temperatures in Ireland in 1958-2022.

      The LOWESS trendline shows a clear increase from 9.5&#176C; to
      10.4&#176C;, but the temperature varies a lot month-to-month. <br />
      Let's try to compensate for that by averaging the temperature over each
      year.

      Now the trend is far more clear. <br />
      Can we find a correlation between this temperature trend, and the rate at
      which glaciers are melting?

      This is an overlay of the two graphs we're trying to find a correlation
      between. Both show a rather pronounced upward trend. <br />
      But can we show this correlation in numbers? <br />
      A great tool for this kind of analysis is the Pearson correlation
      coefficient.

    <h3>
      Plugging the two datasets into the correlation function, the resulting
      correlation coefficint is {{color_temp_diff_to_mass}}.
    </h3>

      This shows that there is a strong correlation between the temperature in
      Ireland, and the rate at which glaciers are melting globally!
